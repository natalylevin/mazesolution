## Maze Solver GUI

This project implements a graphical user interface (GUI) to visualize and solve maze problems using Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm.

**Features:**

* User selects the algorithm (DFS) and maze size through dialog boxes.
* Maze is randomly generated with obstacles and empty spaces.
* Start and end points are predefined at opposite corners of the maze.
* The algorithm visually explores the maze, highlighting visited and backtracked squares.
* Upon finding a solution, the path is highlighted in red.
* If no solution exists, a message is displayed.

**Technologies:**

* Java Swing
* Java AWT
* Random

**Further Enhancements:**

* Implement BFS algorithm.
* Allow user to define start and end points.
* Add support for different maze generation algorithms.
* Improve visualization with animations and color schemes.
